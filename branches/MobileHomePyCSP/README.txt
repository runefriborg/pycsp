PyCSP is a CSP library for Python that implements core CSP
functionality with some extensions from pi-calculus.

Providing

* Synchronous communication
* Buffered channels
* Multiple process types such as, greenlets, threads, processes and remote processes
* Both input and output guards supported in external choice (Alts)
* A single any-to-any channel type
* Mobile channel-ends
* Retire and poison signals for shutting down networks nicely
* A channel which can communicate using inter-process communication as well as sockets.
* A PyCSP providing local and distributed communication using only standard python modules bundled with CPython
* NAT traversal
* Tracing PyCSP executions to a log file, for later visualisation
