0.6.2 - 0.7.0
----------
* Added a wrapper for Alternation to simplify usage. It consists of
  the following constructs AltSelect, InputGuard, OutputGuard,
  SkipGuard and TimeoutGuard:

  AltSelect examples:
           AltSelect(
                   InputGuard(register, action=add_service()),
                   InputGuard(inc, action=dispatch())
                   )

           AltSelect(
                   OutputGuard(left, msg=True, action="right(True)"),
                   OutputGuard(right, msg=True, action="left(True)")
                   )

           ch, msg = AltSelect(
                   InputGuard(workerIn),
                   OutputGuard(workerOut, jobs[-1]),
                   SkipGuard()
                   )

* Added buffered channels to all versions.
  Usage:  A = Channel(buffer=<N>) # where <N> is the wanted buffer size.
  The Channel is implemented in buffer.py as a process maintaining a list of
  buffered elements.
* Fixed (threads) bug in Alternation, where a poison or retire could overwrite a committed match.
* Fixed a poor design choice. The naming __channel_input can have unwanted side-effects
  in Python, thus __channel_input is renamed to channel_input. Sorry for the inconvenience.
* Removed the Channel.status method.
* Fixed bug in propagation of poison / retire.
* Fixed Python 2.4 support for threads implementation.
* Added pycsp.common package that contains plugNplay processes and other general process
  templates.
  Usage:

    from pycsp.threads import *
    from pycsp.common import plugNplay

    Parallel(plugNplay.Prefix(cin, cout, prefix=1))

* Added current_process_id() function for debugging purposes. It returns the unique id of the
  pycsp process executing current_process_id().
* Changed matching of channels in function parameter lists, when propagating retire and poison.
* Changed Alternation.execute to also return (guard, msg) just as Alternation.select.

0.6.1 - 0.6.2
----------
* Changed the reserved variable name for reading channel inputs from ChannelInput
  to __channel_input.
* @choice will now create a function that instantiates a Choice object. This can be used to
  send other arguments to the wrapped choice function.
  Example:
	@choice
	def action(id, __channel_input):
	    print id, __channel_input

	Alternation([{cin:action(42)}]).execute()

* Changed the internal representation of guards in Alternation and added an optional syntax
  for usage in the guardlist. These are now equivalent and legal arguments for Alternation.
 - input guard: [{cin1:action()}]  <->  [(cin1, action())]
 - output guard: [{(cout1, msg):action()}] <-> [(cout1, msg, action()]

* Fixed a bug in reference counting for retire, that could result in a race condition.
* Fixed (greenlets) bug where retire could overwrite a committed request.
* Fixed propagation of poison and retire, when channelends are in lists / dictionaries.
* Added syntactic sugar to allow multiplying processes.
  Example:
	Parallel(
		producer(OUT(jobs),10000, 1000),
		10 * worker(IN(jobs),OUT(results)),
		consumer(IN(results)))


0.6.0 - 0.6.1
----------
* Changed retire() behaviour, to propagate a retire pill. Added ChannelRetireException.
* Fixed possible deadlock, when doing several concurrent alternations on an input
  and output guard. This is an issue in pycsp.threads and pycsp.net.
 - See examples/problems/deadlock_doing_alternation_on_input_and_output_pre_0.6.1.py
* Added a Pyro nameserver lookup to the PyroServerProcess thread, to avoid sharing
  of a global Pyro nameserver proxy, which is not recommended by Pyro.
* Changed greenlet dependency to the greenlet 0.2 module available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet
* Added new Channel methods for returning ChannelEnd objects. +C / -C  and  C.reader() / C.writer()


0.5.2 - 0.6.0
----------
* Added 3 new implementations of PyCSP
 - Processes : Uses the multiprocessing module.
 - Greenlets(coroutine) : Uses a third party py.magic.greenlet module from pylib.
 - Net : Uses Pyro to enable all channels as remote channels.
* Modified examples and tests to support all 4 implementations (threads, processes,
  greenlets, net)
* import pycsp, defaults to pycsp.threads
* Added a TestSuite system to doctest. Execute python __init__.py to run testsuites.


0.5.1 - 0.5.2
----------
* Added doctest items to classes and functions.
* Fixed Sequence(*plist) to accept list of processes.


0.5.0 - 0.5.1
----------
* Fixed race condition with poisoning.
* Optimized ChannelEnd implementation.
* Added Spawn for starting background CSP processes.
* Added Skip and Timeout guards.
* Added @choice decorator to clearify where actions are defined. Usage is optional.
* Added @io decorator for compatibility with PyCSP coroutine implementation.
* A nameless Channel requests a name using uuid.uuid1().


all versions - 0.5.0
----------
The PyCSP library has been completely rewritten.

There is no backwards compatibility.

For now please look at the examples for documentation on how to use the library.
