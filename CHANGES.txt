0.9.1 - 0.9.2
* Added Python 3 support
* Fixed issue with leaking mobile channelends during shutdown
 - See examples/problems/parallel_leaking_mobile_channelend_garbage_collection_pre_0.9.2.py
* Reorganised the distribution of PyCSP to always include both pycsp.parallel and
  pycsp.greenlets 
* Removed ssh_python and cluster_python parameters from @sshprocess and @clusterprocess.
  The remote python interpreter will use the full path of sys.executable to find the
  correct installation.
* Fixed bug, where an internal call to select.select would throw an unwanted exception

0.9.0 - 0.9.1
* Parallel and Sequence now returns a list of return values from all the processes.
  >>> Parallel(P1(), P2())
  ['Hello', 'World']
* Added remote process implementations
  @sshprocess(ssh_host, ssh_port=22, ssh_user, ssh_password, ssh_python='python')
  @clusterprocess(cluster_nodefile="$PBS_NODEFILE", cluster_pin, cluster_hint='blocked', cluster_ssh_port=22, cluster_python='python'):
   

0.7.1 - 0.9.0
----------
* threads, processes and net has been completely rewritten into a new single
  implementation named pycsp.parallel. Thus available implementations are now
    - pycsp.parallel (default)
    - pycsp.greenlets
* pycsp.greenlets has not been changed. Simple and fast.
* The trunk repository has been split into two versions. The base which
  only requires standard CPython libraries and the extras version, which 
  adds all the extra stuff (greenlets, and so on) that requires external 
  libraries.
* Previously buffered channels were implemented as a string of processes. This
  would greatly limit performance, as the latency for communicating across
  a channel would increase. Now, a buffered channel has an internal buffer and
  perform only slightly more work than an unbuffered channel. Also the buffer
  has a location, which means that a buffered channel can be used to hide the
  latency induced by the data-transfer latency.
* All channels in pycsp.parallel are created as network-enabled channels and supports
  communicating with remote processes.
* Added a new process type @multiprocess which runs as an OS-process. This enables
  mixing @process and @multiprocess in one PyCSP network.
* Added a shutdown() method, which must be called at the end of all applications
  importing pycsp. It closes the channel references and waits for all references to
  leave hosted channels, thus ensuring that the PyCSP network is left in a robust
  state.
* Found a design flaw in AltSelect, which means that AltSelect does not guarantee
  priority when affected by network and scheduling latencies. A new PriSelect have
  been added which is slightly slower but does guarantee priority and thus should
  be used whenever the SkipGuard is needed.

0.7.0 - 0.7.1
----------
* (pycsp.greenlets) Fixed issue with communicating on channels from the main namespace.
* (pycsp.greenlets) Fixed propagation of exceptions from io functions.
* Added "fair" version of AltSelect, which uses the history from an Alternation to perform an ordered AltSelect (priority)
* Replaced use of environment variables for some module magic.
* Added pycsp.common.trace module
* Moved AltSelect and FairSelect to a separate file (altselect.py)
* Added Channel() * 3 and 2 * Channel() functionality
* removed const.py from individual implementations.
* Added support for Jython and IronPython in the threads implementation. 

0.6.2 - 0.7.0
----------
* Added a raised Exception('Deadlock') when all processes are blocked on
  channel communication. Only pycsp.greenlets has this deadlock detection.
* Added a wrapper for Alternation to simplify usage. It consists of
  the following constructs AltSelect, InputGuard, OutputGuard,
  SkipGuard and TimeoutGuard:

  AltSelect examples:
           AltSelect(
                   InputGuard(register, action=add_service()),
                   InputGuard(inc, action=dispatch())
                   )

           AltSelect(
                   OutputGuard(left, msg=True, action="right(True)"),
                   OutputGuard(right, msg=True, action="left(True)")
                   )

           ch, msg = AltSelect(
                   InputGuard(workerIn),
                   OutputGuard(workerOut, jobs[-1]),
                   SkipGuard()
                   )

* Added buffered channels to all versions.
  Usage:  A = Channel(buffer=<N>) # where <N> is the wanted buffer size.
  The Channel is implemented in buffer.py as a process maintaining a list of
  buffered elements.
* Fixed (threads) bug in Alternation, where a poison or retire could overwrite a committed match.
* Fixed a poor design choice. The naming __channel_input can have unwanted side-effects
  in Python, thus __channel_input is renamed to channel_input. Sorry for the inconvenience.
* Removed the Channel.status method.
* Fixed bug in propagation of poison / retire.
* Fixed Python 2.4 support for threads implementation.
* Added pycsp.common package that contains plugNplay processes and other general process
  templates.
  Usage:

    from pycsp.threads import *
    from pycsp.common import plugNplay

    Parallel(plugNplay.Prefix(cin, cout, prefix=1))

* Added current_process_id() function for debugging purposes. It returns the unique id of the
  pycsp process executing current_process_id().
* Changed matching of channels in function parameter lists, when propagating retire and poison.
* Changed Alternation.execute to also return (guard, msg) just as Alternation.select.

0.6.1 - 0.6.2
----------
* Changed the reserved variable name for reading channel inputs from ChannelInput
  to __channel_input.
* @choice will now create a function that instantiates a Choice object. This can be used to
  send other arguments to the wrapped choice function.
  Example:
	@choice
	def action(id, __channel_input):
	    print id, __channel_input

	Alternation([{cin:action(42)}]).execute()

* Changed the internal representation of guards in Alternation and added an optional syntax
  for usage in the guardlist. These are now equivalent and legal arguments for Alternation.
 - input guard: [{cin1:action()}]  <->  [(cin1, action())]
 - output guard: [{(cout1, msg):action()}] <-> [(cout1, msg, action()]

* Fixed a bug in reference counting for retire, that could result in a race condition.
* Fixed (greenlets) bug where retire could overwrite a committed request.
* Fixed propagation of poison and retire, when channelends are in lists / dictionaries.
* Added syntactic sugar to allow multiplying processes.
  Example:
	Parallel(
		producer(OUT(jobs),10000, 1000),
		10 * worker(IN(jobs),OUT(results)),
		consumer(IN(results)))


0.6.0 - 0.6.1
----------
* Changed retire() behaviour, to propagate a retire pill. Added ChannelRetireException.
* Fixed possible deadlock, when doing several concurrent alternations on an input
  and output guard. This is an issue in pycsp.threads and pycsp.net.
 - See examples/problems/deadlock_doing_alternation_on_input_and_output_pre_0.6.1.py
* Added a Pyro nameserver lookup to the PyroServerProcess thread, to avoid sharing
  of a global Pyro nameserver proxy, which is not recommended by Pyro.
* Changed greenlet dependency to the greenlet 0.2 module available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet
* Added new Channel methods for returning ChannelEnd objects. +C / -C  and  C.reader() / C.writer()


0.5.2 - 0.6.0
----------
* Added 3 new implementations of PyCSP
 - Processes : Uses the multiprocessing module.
 - Greenlets(coroutine) : Uses a third party py.magic.greenlet module from pylib.
 - Net : Uses Pyro to enable all channels as remote channels.
* Modified examples and tests to support all 4 implementations (threads, processes,
  greenlets, net)
* import pycsp, defaults to pycsp.threads
* Added a TestSuite system to doctest. Execute python __init__.py to run testsuites.


0.5.1 - 0.5.2
----------
* Added doctest items to classes and functions.
* Fixed Sequence(*plist) to accept list of processes.


0.5.0 - 0.5.1
----------
* Fixed race condition with poisoning.
* Optimized ChannelEnd implementation.
* Added Spawn for starting background CSP processes.
* Added Skip and Timeout guards.
* Added @choice decorator to clearify where actions are defined. Usage is optional.
* Added @io decorator for compatibility with PyCSP coroutine implementation.
* A nameless Channel requests a name using uuid.uuid1().


all versions - 0.5.0
----------
The PyCSP library has been completely rewritten.

There is no backwards compatibility.

For now please look at the examples for documentation on how to use the library.
